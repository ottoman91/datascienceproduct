Course project for Developing Data Science Course
This project is based on the mtcars dataset in R.
The application takes a series of user inputs from the user, and then displays the miler per gallon(MPG) figure for the car.
To calculate this figure, a generalized linear model(GLM) was constructed from the mtcars dataset.
This model is then used to figure out the MPG of a user's vehicle based on the values of the different inputs.
